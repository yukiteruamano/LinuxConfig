2015-04-02 12:39:18	@angry_vincent	this ebuild removed
2015-04-02 12:39:23	@angry_vincent	it's bad
2015-04-02 12:39:32	lautriv	why is there an extra kgcc
2015-04-02 12:39:49	@angry_vincent	not sure
2015-04-02 12:40:12	@angry_vincent	kgcc is separate package
2015-04-02 12:40:53	lautriv	yes, and 64 bit kernel only ( descr.) but should not make a difference
2015-04-02 12:41:53	lautriv	indeed, -r1 vanished after --sync.
2015-04-02 12:42:02	@angry_vincent	:)
2015-04-02 12:46:10	lautriv	actually i see gcc 4,9,2 only reasonable because it's now possible to patch the kernel for newer AMD optimisazion ( above K8 ), guess it won't produce any wonder that'S worthe emerge -e @world ?
2015-04-02 12:47:21	@angry_vincent	lautriv: again please :)
2015-04-02 12:49:09	lautriv	i know, sometimes bad phrasing ( thinking german ) . the only real benefit of gcc 4.9.x is to optimize the kernel for AMDs after the K8 series, i guess it is not impressive enought to rebuild world for the difference.

2015-04-02 15:54:49	bo	that this distrib is kinda "nihilistic" cause you have to do everything from scratch

2015-04-02 15:55:32	lautriv	Zero_Chaos, i was not about gentoo but e.g. debian does and afair the last RH had also not really a choice.
2015-04-02 15:55:53	javaJake	bo: the problem with other distros is you're locked into the choices of the admins. With Gentoo and Funtoo, the packages describe what range of customization they support, and by weaving the right settings together, you get the setup you want.
2015-04-02 15:56:16	+Zero_Chaos	lautriv: that's right, those distro's do not have a choice, if you run them, you run systemd.  But you do still have the choice to use distro's and packages which don't require systemd, gentoo and funtoo both being such examples.
2015-04-02 15:56:27	javaJake	bo: the problem is with that flexibility comes responsibility to understand your choices as well, and be able to handle change when things upgrade and certain features go away or show up.
2015-04-02 15:56:50	bo	you mean when installing a software such as libreoffice ?

2015-04-02 17:00:36	lautriv	L29Ah, was not humiliating. just facts. like most people think intel invented the first micocomputer on a chip.
2015-04-02 17:01:23	mingdao	No, Frederick William Rueckheim invinted the first chip.
2015-04-02 17:02:24	lautriv	mingdao, another kind of ;)

2015-04-02 17:04:05	lautriv	emerge needs a progress bar, sometimes good to know how long something may take before finish.

2015-04-02 17:24:07	njsg	because the online query uses the CPU model, and that's not the only thing that says how fast the compilation goes
2015-04-02 17:24:25	njsg	not only does it depend on hdd I/O speed and on the available RAM, but there are CPUs that work both with DDR2 and DDR3...
