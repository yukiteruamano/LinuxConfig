2015-04-02 12:17:12	mark4	no
2015-04-02 12:17:25	mark4	its not saying the partiton is of size zero. its saying the DEVICE is of size 0
2015-04-02 12:17:45	mark4	so mkfs.ext4 refuses to format the second partiton within gparted
2015-04-02 12:18:19	mark4	i think you do this with mkfs.ext4 imagefile.img1(2/3/4) to specify the partition to be formatted
2015-04-02 12:18:34	anunnaki	you sure you didnt make the boot partition and use the default starting and ending partition values? which would partition to the end of the disk
2015-04-02 12:18:44	mark4	where imagefile.img is the loop file imagefile.imgN is the partition

2015-04-02 12:39:07	+_AxS_	hey all ..  i made the mistake of installing pulseaudio the other day to test a package; I've since tried to remove it and so far as I'm aware i've got it purged, but i'm having an issue now where whenever i mute my audio output (via keyboard shortcut specifically) it now mutes both my 'master' and my 'speaker out', but when i unmute it only unmutes my 'master'.  Also until now I don't recall actually having a separate 'speaker out' and 'headphone out'
2015-04-02 12:39:07	+_AxS_	volume control.
2015-04-02 12:39:33	+_AxS_	...so all this leads me to thinking there's still pulseaudio bits left in my system.  Any suggestions where i should look?

2015-04-02 13:14:01	+_AxS_	Tecumseh: You can set this globally if you want 32bit versions of -all- your libs, or you can jsut set it per-package and get a minimal list (which means you'll have less libs than you did with the emul-*'s).
2015-04-02 13:14:29	+_AxS_	searchingfortao: that looks like a python error ...

2015-04-02 13:15:04	+_AxS_	searchingfortao: so 'utils' module is missing from the python implementation you have installed and are currently using (for pip, anyhow)
2015-04-02 13:15:06	Tecumseh	_AxS_, I see. I might just as well go full multi-lib. What might be the breakage?

2015-04-02 13:15:56	+_AxS_	Tecumseh: I personally do the minimal set.  Once you set the abi_x86_32 flags on the core packages it asks for it's really rare to have to change them.

2015-04-02 13:16:36	deper29	so, I definitely don't remember lots of stuff. How do I stop portage from upgrading a package? Would that be in package.accept_keywords?
2015-04-02 13:16:43	+grknight	the major sticking point for abi_x86_32 is qt.. it's not marked stable yet
2015-04-02 13:16:46	+_AxS_	searchingfortao: that would only help if utils is supposed to be part of dev-lang/python instead of an external package.  However, it could also be the issue is the particular python implementation.
